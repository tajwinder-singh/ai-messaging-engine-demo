# Tajstack AI — Production-Grade AI Support & Communication Engine (Demo)

> **This repository contains a safe, limited demo.  
The full production system is private and operated as a managed service.**

## What This Is

This repository showcases a **demo version** of my AI-powered communication assistant.

It demonstrates:
- the **interaction flow**
- how inputs are structured
- how responses are generated
- how an AI system can assist support workflows

This repo is **not** the full product.

## Demo: Interaction Flow (UI + Trigger Example)

Below is a short demo video showing the interaction flow exposed in this public version.

> This represents one surface of a much larger production system.

## What the Production System Actually Is (Private)

The real system (not open-sourced) is a **production-grade, multi-tenant AI support engine** designed for real businesses.

It is **not** a chatbot or a simple email generator.

The production system includes:

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Multi-source knowledge ingestion (PDF, TXT, JSON, internal docs)
- Semantic search with embeddings + FAISS
- Intent classification & routing
- Confidence-based refusal & escalation
- Tone- and context-adaptive responses
- Conversation memory
- Abuse detection & rate limiting
- API authentication + request signing
- Full audit logging & observability
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Operated and monitored as a managed service

The system is designed to **reduce cognitive and drafting burden for support teams**, typically saving **30–45% of agent time per interaction**, while improving consistency, safety, and auditability.

---

## Why This Repository Is a Demo Only

The production system contains:
- proprietary retrieval logic
- security-sensitive workflows
- operational safeguards
- business-critical decision boundaries

For **IP protection and client security**, the full implementation is kept private.

This repository exists to:
- demonstrate capability
- show interaction design
- provide a safe public reference

---

## Demo Features Included Here

- Basic Flask application
- Simple web UI
- Input fields for:
  - purpose
  - tone
  - key points
- Placeholder response generation
- Example request/response flow

This demo does **not** include:
- real retrieval
- vector search
- tenant isolation
- confidence gating
- production safety logic

---

## Tech Stack (Demo)

- Python
- Flask
- Jinja templates (HTML)

---

## Running the Demo Locally

- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python app.py


## How the Real System Is Used

The production system is **API-first** and integrated into:

- internal tools  
- CRMs  
- ticketing systems  
- custom workflows  

It is delivered as a **managed AI service**, not a self-serve SaaS.

---

## Important Design Principle

The system does **not** blindly automate responses.

It may intentionally **defer, refuse, or escalate** requests when confidence is low.

Accuracy, safety, and trust take priority over raw automation.

- a founder  
- a CTO  
- an operations leader

## Final Note

This repository is **not a template** and **not a SaaS starter**.

It represents one piece of a **larger, production-operated AI system** built for real-world business workflows.
